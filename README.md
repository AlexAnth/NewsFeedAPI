The NewsFeed API is a powerful RESTful API built using Spring Boot, Java 17, and Spring WebFlux. Leveraging the reactive programming model, this API provides a high-performance and non-blocking solution for storing and retrieving parliamentary articles in a MongoDB document database. This means that the API is capable of efficient handling of concurrent requests, allowing for optimal utilization of system resources.

With this API, you can effortlessly distribute and manage articles content, with operations like create, read, update, and delete on information resources. Additionally, the API offers robust search functionality, enabling you to find articles based on various criteria, such as keywords, authors, or publication dates. With support for pagination, you can also navigate easily through the extensive collection of articles.

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17
